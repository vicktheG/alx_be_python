This repo is an introduction to python.
It focuses mainly on assignining variables, the correct naming and callling the assigned variables
It also helped me get a better grasp of the process of git by adding each file individually, commiting and pushing. This entire process solidifies the grasp of the git concept.
It also introduced the concept of basic arithmetics and logic.
It introduced the basic concept of algorithms and thus logical thinking.
This was my first month in the bootcamp and it introduced the concept of logging and thus this README file.
